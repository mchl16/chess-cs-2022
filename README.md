# C# chess client

As the name suggests (or not?), this is a C# implementation of chess. It supports rules likes castling, en passant etc. The default client is a modest CLI, however, it can be expanded to support a GUI (but I'd rather do sth more ambitious).

# Build

You need to have the latest version of .NET, just type `dotnet build` to compile the game.
